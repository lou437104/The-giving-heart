# 🎉 Summer Charity Ball Fundraiser Page

This is a simple, heartfelt fundraising webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to support our school's **Summer Charity Ball**.

## ❤️ About

We work in a dedicated **SEN (Special Educational Needs)** department, and this year we are raising money for two charities that are incredibly close to our hearts:

- **Teenage Cancer Trust**
- **St Giles Hospice**

Not everyone can attend the ball — so we created this page so that friends, family, and supporters can still take part by **donating online** and **playing a fun game to help spread awareness**.

## 💻 What's Included

- A donation call-to-action with a button linking to an external donation page
- A light-hearted game ("Charity Logo Memory Match") built with JavaScript
- A mobile-friendly, accessible design using HTML and CSS

- Spread awareness of the causes we support

Once all pairs are matched, players see a celebratory message thanking them for playing.
