    <h2>Why are we holding a summer charity ball</h2>
    <p>The SEN department is holding a summer charity ball because as some of you are aware Cancer has affected numerous members of staff and their families in this school, it is especially close to the SEN departments heart at the moment. </p>


        <p> to this, the SEN department have decided to put on a Charity Ball (Black Tie and Posh Dresses) in the Summer Term to raise awareness and hopefully some money for the two following charities: <ul>
        
       <li> Teenage Cancer Trust </li>
       <li> St Giles Hospice </li> 
    </ul>
    </p> 
        
        <p> the Black Country beer bus is no longer available for our end of year social, we thought it would be a perfect opportunity for a end of year gathering for some great causes. </p>
        
         
        
    <p>We have secured Essington Working Men's Club as our venue for Saturday 5th July at 7pm. The costing for tickets will be Â£25 a person, this will include entertainment and food. We would also like to offer this out to your partners/friend to raise as much as possible (please be aware this will be an over 18s event). </p>
